# CAF Smart Auth React Native

This repository contains two distinct projects that provide support for **CafSmartAuth** in React Native applications:

1. **caf-smart-auth-react-native-cli**: Uses **Native Modules** to bridge the gap between JavaScript and native code (Android and iOS).
2. **caf-smart-auth-react-native-expo**: Based on **Expo Modules**, enabling a simplified integration with Expo projects.
